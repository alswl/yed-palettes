# yed-fa-palettes

[yED](http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/) palettes with SVG icons generated from the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) collection.

Palettes are grouped according to the categories at http://fontawesome.io/icons/

I might add different palette groups that make more sense for yED in the future. (For networking diagrams, etc.)

You can import the palettes from [/palettes/default/](/palettes/default/) in yED as described [here](http://yed.yworks.com/support/manual/palette_manager.html).
